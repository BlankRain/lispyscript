## A Javascript with Lispy syntax and Macros!
Lispyscript is Javascript using a 'Lispy' syntax, and compiles to Javascript.

An inherent problem with Javascript is that it has no
macro support, like other Lisp like languages. That's because macros manipulate the syntax tree while
compiling. And this is next to impossible in a language like Javascript. In LispyScript we write Javascript
in a tree structure. If you know Javascript and a Lisp like language, then using LispyScript will be a
breeze. Even if you don't know a Lispy Language, all you need to learn is to write code in a tree structure.

#### LispyScript was inspired by [Beating the averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html).
