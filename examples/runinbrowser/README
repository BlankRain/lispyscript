This directory contains a copy of the "Run in the browser" example at:

    http://lispyscript.com/docs/#browserrunning

Note that (as mentioned on that web page above) to run this example you must first:

  a.  Create the browser-bundle.js file.

  To do this cd to the "js" sub-directory and run the command:

    lispy -b

  This will copy browser-bundle.js to the current directory.

b.  Serve index.html using some type of web server.

  Note this is required to run this example.

  If you simply open the index.html file directly you will get an error due to cross origin ajax requests.

  You can serve index.html from any web server you like - if you don't have one handy you can simply do:

    npm install http-server -g

  Then while in this "runinbrowser" example directory simply run:

    http-server

  Then just hit in your browser the url:

    http://localhost:8080/index.html
